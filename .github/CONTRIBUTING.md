### Project goals
> **Shopify Theme Lab** was built to provide a great developer experience while crafting Shopify themes.

#### This project aims to be:
- **Modular** - It should be effortless to alter, add, remove or swap any component.
- **Fast** - Automating tedious processes as much as possible.
- **Intuitive** - This project as a whole, file contents and directory structure should be quick to grasp and easy to work with.
- **Modern** - Gone are the days of jQuery.

Please keep the above points in mind when submitting issues or adding new features.

### Bug reports
A good bug report should be easy to understand and as detailed as possible. Explanations on how to reproduce the problem and/or screenshots are a great help.

### Feature requests
Before submitting a feature request try to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. Provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Pull requests
Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a great help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before starting any significant pull request (e.g. implementing new features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that might not be merged into the project.

Also follow to the coding conventions used throughout the project (indentation, comments, etc.).

> All pull requests should be submitted to the `dev` branch, **not** the `master` branch.
